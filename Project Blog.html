              <p>Before making your first investment, take the time to learn the basics about the stock market and the individual securities composing the market. There is an old adage: It is not a stock market, but a market of stocks. Your focus will be upon individual securities which you are investing in and the relationship with the broader economy and the factors that drive your stock.</p>

              <h2>Invest only your surplus funds</h2>
              <p>The biggest mistake newbie investors make is to invest money that they can’t actually afford to lose. Investing in the stock market is risky, and that means that you can potentially lose everything. Like any investment, there are inherent risks associated with the stock market. Some are the risks related to the overall market as systematic risk that you can’t avoid by diversifying your portfolio, while some risks are stock-specific that you can avoid.</p>

              <h2>Avoid Leverage</h2>
              <p>Leverage simply means use of borrowed money to execute your stock market strategy. In a margin account, banks and brokerage firms can lend you money to buy stocks. It sounds great when the stock market is moving up, but consider the other side when the stock market or your stock goes down. In that case your loss would not only erode your initial investment, but you will also have to pay interest to the broker. Leverage is, thus, a tool, neither good nor bad. </p>

              <h2>Avoid herd mentality</h2>
              <p>Unlike many investors do, you should avoid the herd mentality that is influenced by the actions of your acquaintances, neighbors or relatives without evaluating the current information and underlying stocks. Thus, if everybody around is investing in a particular stock, the tendency for potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run if you have not chosen the stock by careful analysis. So, if you really don’t understand about the stock, never step in.</p>

              <h2>Don’t let emotions impact your investment</h2>
              <p>Separate your emotion from any particular stock as many investors end losing money in the stock markets due to their inability to control emotions. Get rid of the fear and greed cycle. Do not invest in any speculative unknown stock lured by its past fabulous return without understanding the risk involved that will lead you to suffer loss. In a bear market, control your fear and don’t panic and sell shares at rock-bottom prices. Thus, fear and greed are the worst emotions to feel when investing, and it is better not to be guided by them.</p>

                <h2> Have realistic expectations</h2>
                <p> lots of stocks have generated more than 100 per cent returns during the great bull run of recent years. However, it doesn’t mean that you should always expect the same kind of return from the stock markets. If you feel that stocks in your portfolio are overvalued, it is better to switch to a relatively low value good stock.</p>
